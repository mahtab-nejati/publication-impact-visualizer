# Visualization of Publication Impact

This visualization tool has been developed as part of the course work for [_CS848 (The Art and Science of Empirical Computer Science) Fall-2022_](https://github.com/lintool/art-science-empirical-cs).
The course is instructed by [_Prof. Jimmy Lin_](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/index.html) at _University of Waterloo_.

The visualization implements an interactive version of Figure 1.5.1 from the book ["**The Scinece of Science**"](https://www.dashunwang.com/book/the-science-of-science).
It is deployed on Heroku. Feel free to access the tool through [this link](https://impactvis.herokuapp.com/app).
